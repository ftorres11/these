    This dissertation is organized in the following manner: First
    we introduce a background on existing approaches towards interpretability of image
    recognition models; for that, we make mention on current architectures dedicated 
    to this approach, while also presenting concepts on interpretability and enunciating 
    current approaches for this study. 
    In Chapter \ref{ch:opticam}, we propose Opti-CAM as a methodology that generates 
    optimized saliency maps highlighting the relevant regions on an image towards image
    classification. Section \ref{sec:av_gain} extends evaluation metrics with the 
    introduction of a novel measurement yielding improvements on model confidence 
    when using a given attribution approach. 
    On Sections \ref{sec:oc_qual} and \ref{sec:oc_quant} we highlight the differences 
    between Opti-CAM and existing procedures. Chapter \ref{ch:castream} introduces 
    the Cross Attention Stream, an approach to boost existing architectures
    interpretable properties. Section \ref{sec:ca_defn} sets up the cross-attention 
    mechanism that is used as a building block for this stream and its similarities with
    self-attention.  Section \ref{sec:ca_design} expands the attention mechanism 
    towards its incorporation on current architectures and its usage stand-alone or alongside
    multiple stages of these architectures. On Sections \ref{sec:ca_qual} and \ref{sec:ca_quant}
    we demonstrate the benefits of using this proposal.
    Chapter \ref{ch:zip} raises the Zero-Information algorithm and its usage as a substitute
    for mask-dependent evaluation proposals. Section \ref{sec:zip_algo} develops this 
    algorithm. Section \ref{sec:zip_insdel} demonstrates the incorporation of this 
    algorithm on interpretability evaluation protocols. Section \ref{sec:zip_qual} displays
    the effect of this approach when applied to mask patches on images. Section \ref{sec:zip_benchmark} 
    displays the results of benchmarking these protocols with this approach. Finally, 
    we draw conclusions on our work and detail future research perspectives.
