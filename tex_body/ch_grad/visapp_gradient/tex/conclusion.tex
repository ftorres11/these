%\green{TO DO}
In this paper, we propose a new training approach to improve the gradient of a CNN in terms of interpretability.
Our methods forces the gradient obtained from back-propagation at the input image level to align with the gradient coming from guided backpropagation. 
The results of our training are presented according to several metrics and interpretability methods. Our method offers consistent improvement on four out of five metrics for two networks.
