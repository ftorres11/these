\section{Qualitative Evaluation}
\label{sec:grad_qual}
We visualize the effect of our approach on saliency maps and gradients, obtained for the baseline 
model \vs the one trained with our approach.
\input{fig/grad/tex/cam_mainfig.tex}


\noindent \autoref{fig:salient} shows saliency maps. We observe the differences brought by our 
training method. The differences are particularly important for Grad-CAM, which directly averages 
the gradient to weigh feature maps. Interestingly, the differences are smaller for Score-CAM, which 
is not gradient-based but only obtains changes of predicted probabilities.

\noindent \autoref{fig:grads} shows gradients. We observe slightly less noise with our method, while 
the object of interest is better covered by gradient activations.
