\section{Qualitative Evaluation}

\autoref{fig:vis-in-chest-n-kvasir-resnet} illustrates saliency map examples from ImageNet, Chest 
X-ray and Kvasir datasets. Opti-CAM saliency map is in general more spread out. This better 
highlights full objects, multiple instances or background context, which may be taken into account 
by the model. On Chest X-ray, Opti-CAM and Score-CAM are the only methods that capture the chest, 
while all others focus on image corners.
