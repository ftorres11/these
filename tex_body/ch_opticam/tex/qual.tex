\section{Qualitative Evaluation}
\label{sec:oc_qual}
\autoref{fig:vis-in-chest-n-kvasir-resnet} illustrates saliency map examples from ImageNet, Chest 
X-ray and Kvasir datasets. Opti-CAM saliency map is in general more spread out. This better 
highlights full objects, multiple instances or background context, which may be taken into account 
by the model. On Chest X-ray, Opti-CAM and Score-CAM are the only methods that capture the chest, 
while all others focus on image corners. More examples on datasets and networks as well as 
quantitative evaluation on medical data are given in \autoref{medicaldata_ablation}.
