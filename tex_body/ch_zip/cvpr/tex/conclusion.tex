\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

With our work, we reconsider what zero information really means for the model, and construct robust criteria to secure it. Our focus is on those criteria, and not the model in hand, which comes with its own disadvantages. In the future, more robust criteria could be developed for the construction of the loss, and other models could be used to alleviate some drawbacks of MAE. This could eventually lead to the design of more powerful attribution methods and evaluation metrics. The range of applications is wide.
