\subsubsection*{Interpretable Image Recognition}
Average drop ($\AD$) and average increase ($\AI$) \cite{chattopadhay2018grad} are well-established classification metrics. 
They measure the effect on the predicted class probabilities by masking the input image with the saliency map. Let $p^c_i$ and $o^c_i$ 
be the predicted probability for class $c$ given as input the $i$-th test image $\vx_i$ and its masked version respectively. 
Masking refers to element-wise multiplication with the saliency map, which is at the same resolution as the original image with values in $[0,1]$. 
Let $N$ be the number of test images. Class $c$ is taken as the ground truth.

\emph{Average drop} ($\AD$) quantifies how much predictive power, measured as class probability, is lost when we only mask the image; lower is better:
\begin{equation}
	\AD(\%) \defn \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{[p^c_i - o^c_i]_+}{p^c_i} \cdot 100.
\label{eq:ad}
\end{equation}

\emph{Average increase} ($\AI$), also known as \emph{increase in confidence}, measures the percentage of images where the masked
 image yields a higher class probability than the original; higher is better:
\begin{equation}
	\AI(\%) \defn \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N \mathbb{1}_{p^c_i < o^c_i} \cdot 100.
\label{eq:ai}
\end{equation}

$\AD$ and $\AI$ are not defined in a symmetric way. $\AD$ measures changes in class probability whereas $\AI$ measures a 
percentage of images. It is possible that the percentage is high while the actual increase is small. Hence, it is possible that an attribution method improves both. 
Indeed, \cite{poppi2021revisiting} observes that a trivial method called Fake-CAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including Score-CAM, 
by a large margin. Fake-CAM simply defines a saliency map where the top-left pixel is set to zero and is uniform elsewhere. This questions the purpose of $\AD$ and $\AI$.
