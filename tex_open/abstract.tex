Computer Vision applications using Deep Learning technologies have undergone a remarkable 
revolution in the past decade, enabling them to conduct complex tasks over time. In particular, one 
Computer Vision task that has greatly benefitted from these advances is image recognition. 
Progress in this field has paved the way for further developments in complementary fields of 
Computer Vision, models developed for image recognition are modified to conduct image segmentation 
and reconstruction.\\

\noindent The Deep Learning revolution has occurred in two stages: first with the reemergence and 
popularization of convolutional neural networks, and in second place with the 
introduction of attention based architectures. On one hand, on their early days convolutional 
neural networks were hard to train, given their complexity and data volume requirements. 
%Still, early proposals showed promise, such as LeNet with the automatic recognition of handwritten 
%digits in the US postal service in the early 1990s. 
However, in the early years of the 2010s decade these issues were solved with the widespread of 
large scale visual recognition datasets, as well as with the effective use of \glspl{gpu} for 
computation. On the other hand, close to the end of this decade a new style of model emerged: 
the Transformer architecture. This architecture creates an abstract representation of classes 
that interacts with every element of an encoding, generating a representation that learns a 
class representation. Additionally, Transformers can process larger volumes of data, 
allowing them to be robust to bias and generalize better.\\

\noindent Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers have completely changed the landscape of 
deep learning and image recognition, and as such, they have permeated deep into society with the 
automatization of many daily tasks. Thus, it is no longer a question of \emph{can a model perform 
this task?}, but more a question of \emph{how does this model perform this task?}. To address these 
questions a new research field has emerged: explainable AI.\\
