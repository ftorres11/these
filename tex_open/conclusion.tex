\section{Conclusion}
%% Check
In this chapter, we propose a transparency methodology that denoises gradients in the input level, 
improving interpretability properties of CNNs. Our approach aligns the standard gradient with 
the guided gradient, regularizing the training of neural networks.\\

\noindent We validate our claims on improvement of interpretability properties using post-hoc 
interpretability evaluation. Our approach displays improvements in these properties and on image 
recognition. However, an optimized version of this study better suited for datasets 
and more complex models. Additional experimentation is required to address these 
limitations. An optimization of our training paradigm reducing its computational would make 
the method scalable.
